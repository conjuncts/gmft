Abstract
Background: Patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 respond poorly to standard treatment with
50% or less achieving sustained virologic response. Predicting outcome is essential and could help avoid
unnecessary treatment and reduce health cost. Recently, an association of amino acid substitutions in the core
region and treatment outcome was observed in Japanese patients. In the present study, the impact of these
mutations on response kinetics and treatment outcome was explored in Caucasian patients.
Methods: The core region of HCV pre-treatment samples obtained from 50 patients treated with peginterferon/
ribavirin in a previous Swedish clinical trial with genotype 1 infection were sequenced. The alleles at rs12979860, a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), were assessed in order to identify any co-association with this strong
response predictor.
Results: No association between treatment response and substitutions of core residue 91 was found. In contrast,
substitutions of core residue 70 were observed in 6/21 (29%) non-responders, but only in one of 29 responders (p =
0.03), and were more common in subgenotype 1b (R70Q in 6 of 13 strains) than in 1a (R70P in 1 of 37 strains, p =
0.004). The rs12979860 SNP upstream of the IL28B gene was overall the strongest response predictor (p = 0.0001).
Core 70 substitutions were associated with poorer response kinetics in patients carrying the CT genotype at
rs12979860.
Conclusions: The results indicate that substitutions of core residue 70 are related to treatment response in
Caucasian patients with HCV-1b infection, but are of less importance than IL28B polymorphism.
Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of
cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer affecting approxi￾mately
170 million persons worldwide [1]. Combination
therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (Peg￾IFN/RBV),
given for 24 to 72 weeks, may eradicate the
infection and stop progression of liver damage [2-4], but
many patients do not achieve sustained virologic
response (SVR). For this reason, and in light of high
costs and frequent side effects, it is important to identify
factors that can predict the likelihood of response.
Several host factors such as age, stage of liver fibrosis,
body mass index (BMI), liver steatosis, insulin resistance
and ethnicity, as well as viral genotype influence the
treatment outcome [5]. While the impact on outcome
by genotype is undisputed, with 80% of patients with
genotype 2 or 3 achieving SVR as compared with 50%
for genotype 1, the importance of subtypes [6], regional
variability or mutations are controversial. In 1995 it was
reported from Japan that mutations in a part of the
NS5A region were associated with treatment response
in genotype 1b patients. The association between

_rich_page_3_text = r"""Subgenotypes, core mutations and treatment response
The virologic response was not associated with substitu￾tions
at residue 91. However, a poor response was asso￾ciated
with substitutions of core residue 70: One of the
7 patients (14%) with substitutions at residue 70 (six
subtype 1b strains with Q70 and one subtype 1a strain
with P70) achieved SVR, as compared with 28 of 43
patients (65%) carrying strains with R70 (p = 0.03).
Substitutions of core residues 70 and 91 were closely
linked to subgenotype 1b: Six (5 non-SVR) of 13 geno￾type
1b strains had Q70, while only one of 37 subgeno￾type
1a strain had a substitution (P70) at this site (p =
0.0007). Similarly, all 1a strains had cysteine at residue
91, while in 1b 9 had methionine and 4 had leucine (p <
0.0001). This association between core variability and
genotype was further explored by analysis of 3313
sequences from the HCV Database Project (http://hcv.
lanl.gov/), showing a predominance (≥93%) of R70 in
genotypes 1a, 2, 3 and 4, and high rates of Q70 in 1b, 5
and 6 (Table 3). In the 13 patients carrying subtype 1b
strains, the correlation was strong: 7 of 8 responders
had arginine (R70) and 5 non-responders had glutamine
(Q70) at residue 70 (p = 0.005). In contrast, in the 37
patients with 1a infection, all the 21 patients with SVR
carried HCV with R70, while 15 of the 16 non-SVR car￾ried
strains with R70.
Phylogenetic analysis of NS5A and ISDR substitutions
In order to find out if the variability at positions 70 and
91 was linked to subgroups of HCV-1b phylogenetic
analysis of NS5A was performed, including the 13
strains from the present study as well as database
sequences. The different core 70/91 variants were found
in many sub-branches of the tree without clustering,
indicating that they are not the result of a few historical
mutations but evolve continuously (data not shown).
One substitution within ISDR (as compared with the
HCV-J reference sequence) was observed in 9 of the 13
subgenotype 1b strains (7 H2218R, 2 H2218N), and 2
substitutions (H2219Y and D2225E) were seen in one
strain. There was no association between ISDR substitu￾tion
and treatment response.
IL28B SNP
The rs12979860 T allele frequency was 40% as com￾pared
with 46% in 163 health subjects without HCV
infection. The CC genotype, which has been associated
with better treatment response in several previous stu￾dies,
was identified in 18 patients, and 16 of them (89%)
were achieved SVR. The unfavourable SNP genotype
(TT) was found in 8 patients and none of them was
responder. The remaining 24 patients were CT hetero￾zygous,
13 (54%) of them achieved SVR. In an attempt
to explore whether core variation might have an impact
on response irrespective of rs12979860, the viral kinetics
in patients carrying the CT SNP genotype and different
HCV core variants was compared. As shown in Figure 1
